        <h2>SCOPE</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy (hereafter referred to as the “Policy”) outlines the manner in which The Company handles
          the information and personal data which You have provided to Us (or which We have collected) and which enables
          Us to be able to effectively manage the relationship which You have with Us.<br><br>This Policy applies to Our
          websites, applications, products and/or services that link to this policy or do not have a separate privacy
          policy (hereinafter referred to as Our services). This privacy policy is intended to give You a better
          understanding of the data We collect, the reason why We collect such data, the manner in which We process this
          data, the entities with whom We share the said personal data, Your rights in relation to the collection,
          processing and sharing of such data and any other pertinent matter relating to privacy and security.<br><br>Any
          personal data You will provide or which We already hold will be processed in line with and in the manner set
          out in this Privacy Policy. Any and all information will be provided through any of The Company websites (“The
          Website”), the designated telephone numbers or any other means which The Company may make available from time
          to time.<br><br>By reading this Policy, you understand and acknowledge that your Personal Data may be
          processed in the ways set forth in this Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy,
          please do not use the Website or otherwise provide us with your Personal Information.<br><br>Any reference in
          this Policy to "Company", "Us" or "Our" (and all declensions of those words) refers to the Data Controller
          referred to as Fair Game G.P. N.V. (141938) and registered at Abraham de Veerstraat 9, Curacao <br><br>All
          processing of Personal Data performed by The Company as envisaged in this Privacy Policy shall be carried out
          in line with:<br>● The National Ordinance on the Protection of Personal Data (hereafter referred to as the
          “DPA”) as well as any other subsidiary legislation issued under the DPA, both as may be amended from time to
          time; and<br>● Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of The European Parliament And of The Council of 27 April 2016 On The
          Protection of Natural Persons With Regard to The Processing of Personal Data And On The Free Movement of Such
          Data, And Repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)” (hereinafter referred to as “the
          Regulation” or “GDPR”).<br><br>The DPA and the GDPR shall hereafter be collectively referred to as the “Data
          Protection Laws”.<br><br>The Company determines the means and purposes of the processing of Personal Data and
          therefore acts as the “Data Controller” in terms of the applicable Data Protection Laws.<br><br><br></p>
        <h2>DEFINITIONS</h2>
        <p><strong>Data Controller<br></strong><br>“The Data Controller” means the natural or legal person, public
          authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the
          processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member
          State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member
          State law.<br><br><strong>The Data Processor</strong><br><br>“The Data Processor” means a natural or legal
          person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the
          controller.<br><br><strong>Personal Data<br></strong><br>“Personal Data” means any information that identifies
          You individually or relates to an identified or identifiable natural person which can also be defined as data
          subject.<br><br><br></p>
        <h2>SECURITY</h2>
        <p>The Company has adopted a secure communication protocol via the Internet TLS 1.2, used to implement the
          protected remittances. This protocol involves the encryption of Your Personal Data during transmission over
          the internet. Moreover, The Company stores Your Personal <br>Data digitally on encrypted hard drives which is
          an additional guarantee of security of personal data.<br><br>Our services are registered with site
          identification authorities so that your browser can confirm Our identity before any personally identifiable
          information is sent. In addition, our secure servers protect this information using advanced firewall
          technology.</p>
        <h2><br>PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION</h2>
        <p>Personal Data held by Us is protected using the highest industry standard security processes and systems. Our
          commitment to protect personal data is not merely through quality and high standards but also through the best
          and most efficient application of the law. We are bound to only process personal data if such processing is
          based on a genuine and legitimate reason to do so on the basis of one of the legal grounds established in the
          GDPR.<br><br><br></p>
        <h2>PROCESSING ON THE BASIS OF OUR LEGITIMATE INTERESTS</h2>
        <p>A legitimate interest exists when We have a business or commercial reason upon which personal data will be
          processed. In such a case We undertake to protect any and all of Your personal data and the manner in which
          such data is processed and to ensure that such processing would not be unfair to You or to Your
          interest.<br><br>If and when We decide to process Your personal data on the basis of legitimate interest, We
          will inform You of such, what said legitimate interest are and provide a process whereby You will be able to
          raise any questions and/or objections which You way have in relation to such processing. It is important to
          note that The Company is not obliged to stop processing if the grounds for processing over-ride Your right to
          object. An example of this can be in the case where we need to process your data to abide with the anti money
          laundering purposes. This also applies when we act in accordance with the binding requirements of Curacao law,
          as it is our legitimate interest to operate lawfuly.<br><br><br></p>
        <h2>PROCESSING ON THE BASIS OF YOUR CONSENT</h2>
        <p>Consent is not the only ground we may be permitted or obliged to rely on to process Your personal data. We
          will only process personal data on the basis of Your consent where we cannot or otherwise choose not to rely
          on any ulterior legal ground (such as compliance with a legal obligation or legitimate interest). Where we
          process Your personal data on the basis of Your consent, you shall have the right to withdraw your consent at
          any time and in the same manner as it had been previously provided by Yourself. In the case that You exercise
          Your right to withdraw consent, we would then determine whether we are able (or obliged) to process Your
          personal data on the basis of any other legal ground other than consent. If this is the case We will notify
          You accordingly. Any such withdrawal of Your consent will not invalidate any processing operations carried out
          prior to You having withdrawn Your consent.<br><br><br></p>
        <h2>DATA RETENTION POLICY</h2>
        <p>Any and all personal data The Company will keep will be protected in the best way possible and will only be
          used for purposes which are compatible with the applicable Data Protection Laws as well as any other
          applicable laws. The Company will retain Your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary (taking into
          consideration the purpose for which it was originally obtained). The criteria We use to determine what is
          ‘necessary’ depends on the particular Personal Data in question and the specific relationship We have with You
          (including its duration).<br><br>Generally, Our normal practice is to determine whether there is/are any
          specific law(s) (for example tax or corporate laws) permitting or even obliging Us to keep certain Personal
          Data for a certain period of time (in which case We will keep the Personal Data for the maximum period
          indicated by any such law). For example, any data that can be deemed to be “transactional data” must be kept
          for at least five (5) years.<br><br>We would also have to determine whether there are any laws and/or
          contractual provisions that may be invoked against Us by You and/or third parties and if so, what the
          prescriptive periods for such actions are (this is usually five (5) years). In the latter case, We will keep
          any relevant Personal Data that We may need to defend Ourselves against any claim(s), challenge(s) or other
          such action(s) by You and/or third parties for such time as is necessary.<br><br>Where Your Personal Data is
          no longer required by Us, We will either securely delete or anonymise the Personal Data in question.<br><br>Failure
          to provide Your Personal Data may prevent The Company from meeting its legal and regulatory obligations,
          fulfilling its contractual obligations and rendering and/or performing the necessary services needed to
          satisfactorily manage and maintain Your account. Therefore, failure to provide the necessary personal data may
          lead to The Company being unable to provide You with certain products and/or services.<br><br><br></p>

        <h2>PROCESSING ON THE BASIS OF CONSENT</h2>
        <p>For the avoidance of all doubt, We would like to point out that in those limited cases where We cannot or
          choose not to rely on another legal ground (for example, Our legitimate interests), We will process Your
          Personal Data on the basis of Your consent.<br><br>In those cases where We process on the basis of Your
          consent (which We will never presume but which We shall have obtained in a clear and manifest manner from
          You), YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO WITHDRAW YOUR CONSENT AT ANY TIME and this, in the same manner as You shall have
          provided it to Us.<br><br>Should You exercise Your right to withdraw Your consent at any time (by writing to
          Us at the physical or email address below), We will determine whether at that stage an alternative legal basis
          exists for processing Your Personal Data (for example, on the basis of a legal obligation to which We are
          subject) where We would be legally authorised (or even obliged) to process Your Personal Data without needing
          Your consent and if so, notify You accordingly.<br><br>When We ask for such Personal Data, You may always
          decline, however should You decline to provide Us with necessary data that We require to provide requested
          services, We may not necessarily be able to provide You with such services (especially if consent is the only
          legal ground that is available to Us).<br><br>Just to clarify, consent is not the only ground that permits Us
          to process Your Personal Data. In the last preceding section above We pointed out the various grounds that We
          rely on when processing Your Personal Data for specific purposes.<br><br><br></p>

        <h2>AUTHORISED DISCLOSURES OF PERSONAL DATA TO THIRD PARTIES</h2>
        <p>Without prejudice to anything else contained in this Privacy Policy, personal data relating to You may be
          shared with authorised third parties or any of the relevant competent authorities located in or outside of the
          EU/EEA where such disclosures are permitted or required pursuant to Data Protection Laws and/or any other
          applicable legislation.<br><br>These authorised third parties may include but are not limited to entities
          within The Company, other third parties and organisations such as law enforcement agencies, collaborating
          accounting and auditing firms, regulators, relevant authorities and digital marketing providers. We may also
          share such personal data with organisations who have introduced You to Us, third parties which You have asked
          Us or permitted Us to share Your data with or any other third party which We must necessarily share Your
          personal data with so as to be able to provide the products and/or services which You have requested. The
          personal data shared will depend on the product/s and or service/s You choose to use.<br><br>When any such
          personal data has to be transferred outside of the EEA – European Economic Area, We ensure that all the
          necessary and appropriate safeguards are in place. We may also disclose personal information to other
          companies within associated or subsidiary companies and to business partners, or successors in title to Our
          business. The manner in which data transfer outside the EEA is handled is detailed below. Your Personal Data
          will never be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes (unless You give Your consent
          thereto).<br><br><br></p>

          Protection Laws) to/with members and staff of The Company, to/with other entities within The Company (for
          example in compliance with legal obligations) and/or to/with affiliated entities and/or sub-contractors if
          pertinent to any of the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy (including to/with Our services providers who
          facilitate the functionality of the Site and/or any service You may require). Personal information will only
          be shared by Us to provide the services You request from Us or for any other lawful reason (including
          authorised disclosures not requiring Your consent).<br><br>Any such authorised disclosures will be done in
          accordance with the Data Protection laws (for example, all Our processors are contractually bound by the
          requirements in the said Data Protection Laws, including a strict obligation to keep any information they
          receive confidential and to ensure that their employees/personnel are also bound by similar obligations). The
          said service providers (Our processors) are also bound by a number of other obligations (in particular, those
          established in Article 28 of the GDPR).<br><br>Your Personal Data will never be shared with third parties for
          their own marketing purposes (unless You give Your consent thereto).<br><br><br></p>
        <h2>INTERNET COMMUNICATIONS</h2>
        <p>You will be aware that data sent via the Internet may be transmitted across international borders even where
          sender and receiver of information are located in the same country. We cannot be held responsible for anything
          done or omitted to be done by You or any third party in connection with any Personal Data prior to Our
          receiving it including but not limited to any transfers of Personal Data from You to Us via a country having a
          lower level of data protection than that in place in the European Union, and this, by any technological means
          whatsoever (for example, WhatsApp, Skype, Dropbox etc.).<br><br>Moreover, We shall accept no responsibility or
          liability whatsoever for the security of Your data while in transit through the internet unless Our
          responsibility results explicitly from a law having effect in Curacao.<br><br><br></p>
        <h2>ACCURACY OF PERSONAL DATA</h2>

          possible. You can check the information that We hold about You at any time by contacting Us in the manner
          explained below. If You find any inaccuracies, We will correct them and where required, delete them as
          necessary. Please see below for a detailed list of Your legal rights in terms of any applicable data
          protection law.<br><br><br></p>

          EEA. However, we may share Your personal data with certain third parties, as described above, and Your data
          may be accessed or stored by them. Some of these third parties may process Your personal data as
          sub-processors outside the EEA. Your personal data may also be accessed and processed by staff or agents
          operating outside the EEA who work for us Our contract with You.<br><br>Whenever such transfer of your
          personal data outside the EEA occurs, We will ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place, and that Your
